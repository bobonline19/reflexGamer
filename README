Compilation:
	*install the Arduino IDE open the file and upload to an Arduino using the USB
         cable
Assumptions / information:
	*see authors blog post for the circuit
	*assumes: 
		the LEDs are controlled by pins D2, D3, D4, D5, D6
		the LCD is controlled by pins D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12
		the piezo is controlled by pin D13
		the switches use a potential divider circuit sampled by pin A0
		A5 is used to generate random numbers
	*power supply is 6V to the Arduino, the LEDs are high wattage, so require a
	constant current source circuit (described in the post).
